# Investflow

## What is Investflow?

**Investflow** is a modular pipeline for automating the processing of investment transactions — including stocks, options, and dividends — primarily from **Interactive Brokers (IB)** reports in `.csv` format.


The goal is **full automation** from raw report to actionable, structured investment data.
